Project Title: E-commerce Backend Application for Babi E-commerce

Description

This project is the refactored backend for an e-commerce website, developed using Next.js and AdonisJS. It aims to provide a robust, efficient, and scalable backend solution that supports e-commerce operations such as product management, order processing, customer management, and payment integration. By leveraging the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and AdonisJS for a streamlined MVC framework, this backend is designed to offer high performance and a developer-friendly environment.

Features

- **Product Management**: Create, update, delete, and retrieve products with detailed descriptions, images, and pricing.
- **Order Processing**: Manage customer orders, track order status, and handle shipping logistics.
- **Customer Management**: Register and authenticate users, manage customer profiles, and handle customer queries.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing with support for multiple payment gateways.
- **Analytics**: Detailed analytics and reporting tools for tracking sales, customer engagement, and inventory levels.

Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: Used for server-side rendering to improve SEO and performance.
- **AdonisJS**: A fully featured web framework for Node.js, used for building the backend services.
- **PostgreSQL**: The primary database for storing application data.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management to enhance performance.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application for easy deployment and scalability.
